## Monte Carlo Method

This program uses the Monte Carlo Method to calculate pi.

This program throws random ‘darts’ at a ‘dartboard’. It then uses the number of darts that landed on/off the board, and calculates pi based on a simple mathematic principle. The more darts thrown, the more accurate pi becomes.

This is visualized in a simple JFrame with pixels simulating darts thrown. It is runnable on any computer with Java JRE Installed.

The compiled version is available in the "dist" folder.
